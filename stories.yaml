# Google Contacts Project - User Stories
# This file includes both:
# - Stories for aligning email-manager to golang skill conventions
# - Stories for the new google-contacts application
#
# Credentials Strategy: Duplicated auth code with unified scopes
# Both applications have their own pkg/auth/ with IDENTICAL code containing:
# - Gmail scopes (for email-manager)
# - Contacts scopes (for google-contacts)
# Both use the same token file: ~/.credentials/google_token.json
# This ensures single OAuth consent for both apps.

    Restructure email-manager project to follow golang skill conventions.

    Current structure (non-standard):
    ```
    email-manager/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── main.go
    │   ├── cli.go
    │   ├── auth.go
    │   ├── go.mod
    │   └── go.sum
    ```

    Target structure (golang skill compliant):
    ```
    email-manager/
    ├── go.mod              # Module at root
    ├── go.sum
    ├── cmd/
    │   └── email-manager/
    │       └── main.go     # Entry point only
    ├── internal/

    └── pkg/
        └── auth/
            └── auth.go     # OAuth2 authentication (will be duplicated)
    ```

    Acceptance criteria:
    - go.mod moved to project root with correct module path
    - Entry point in cmd/email-manager/main.go (minimal, just wiring)
    - Business logic in internal/ packages
    - Auth code in pkg/auth/ (prepared for duplication to google-contacts)
    - All existing functionality preserved
    - make build && make test pass
  tests:
  - go.mod exists at project root (not in src/)
  - cmd/email-manager/main.go exists and is minimal entry point
  - internal/cli/cli.go exists with command implementations
  - internal/gmail/service.go exists with Gmail service logic
  - pkg/auth/auth.go exists with OAuth2 logic
  - src/ directory no longer exists
  - make clean && make build succeeds
  - ./bin/email-manager --help shows usage
  - all existing commands still work (send, list, get, search, etc.)

  title: "email-manager: Add People API scopes for unified credentials"
  priority: 2
  description: |
    Extend email-manager OAuth2 configuration to include Google People API scopes.
    This enables a single OAuth consent for both email-manager and google-contacts.

    Current scopes (Gmail only):
    - gmail.GmailModifyScope
    - gmail.GmailSendScope
    - gmail.GmailLabelsScope

    New scopes to add (People API):
    - people.ContactsScope (read/write contacts)
    - people.ContactsOtherReadonlyScope (read other contacts)

    IMPORTANT: Adding new scopes will require user re-authorization.
    The token file should be deleted to force re-auth with combined scopes.

    The pkg/auth/auth.go will contain ALL scopes (Gmail + Contacts) so that:
    - email-manager uses Gmail scopes from the unified token
    - google-contacts uses Contacts scopes from the same token
    - User only authorizes once for both apps

    Acceptance criteria:
    - People API scopes added to pkg/auth/auth.go
    - Token file path remains ~/.credentials/google_token.json
    - Re-authorization flow works correctly
    - Gmail functionality still works after re-auth
  tests:
  - pkg/auth/auth.go includes people.ContactsScope
  - pkg/auth/auth.go includes people.ContactsOtherReadonlyScope
  - make build succeeds
  - after deleting token, re-auth prompts for Gmail AND Contacts permissions
  - email-manager list command works after re-auth
  passes: true

    Initialize the google-contacts project following golang skill conventions.
    Duplicate the auth code from email-manager (pkg/auth/auth.go).

    Project structure:

    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ├── Makefile

    └── pkg/
        └── auth/
            └── auth.go     # DUPLICATED from email-manager (identical)
    ```

    The pkg/auth/auth.go must be IDENTICAL to email-manager's version:
    - Same scopes (Gmail + Contacts)
    - Same token file path (~/.credentials/google_token.json)
    - Same credentials file path (~/.credentials/google_credentials.json)

    Features:
    - Cobra CLI framework
    - Basic --help and --version commands
    - Git repository initialized
    - GitHub repository created (smorand/google-contacts, public)

    Acceptance criteria:
    - Project compiles and runs
    - pkg/auth/auth.go is identical to email-manager's version
    - --help shows usage information
    - --version shows version string

    - GitHub repo created and pushed
  tests:
  - go.mod exists at project root
  - cmd/google-contacts/main.go exists
  - internal/cli/cli.go exists with root command
  - pkg/auth/auth.go exists and matches email-manager version
  - Makefile exists with build, test, clean targets
  - README.md exists with project description
  - CLAUDE.md exists for AI interactions
  - .gitignore exists with Go patterns
  - make clean && make build succeeds
  - ./bin/google-contacts --help shows usage

    Implement Google People API service initialization using the duplicated auth.

    Implementation:
    - Import auth package from local pkg/auth
    - Create People API service wrapper in internal/contacts/
    - Handle authentication errors gracefully
    - Test connection with a simple API call

    The service should be created lazily on first command execution,
    not at application startup.

    File structure:
    ```
    internal/
    └── contacts/
        └── service.go    # People API service wrapper
    ```

    Acceptance criteria:
    - People API service can be created
    - Auth flow works (browser opens for first-time auth if no token)
    - If token exists (from email-manager), no re-auth needed
    - Proper error messages for auth failures
  tests:
  - internal/contacts/service.go exists
  - GetPeopleService(ctx) function is implemented
  - make build succeeds
  - if token exists from email-manager, no auth prompt appears
  - if no token, running any command triggers auth flow
